## Title: Restaurant Business Analysis in Orange County (10 most populous cities)

Objective:
- One of our clients, a wealthy investor, would like to open a new restaurant in Orange County, and has narrowed the potential location down to 10 of the County’s most populous cities. 
- Our client wants to know the following: which city they can charge the highest price in, how long they should stay open to maximize customer ratings, and which type of cuisine they should serve based on the most popular customer ratings.
- To do that, we must figure out the most profitable location of the 10 cities selected; how long to keep the restaurant running for, and last but not least, what cuisine to specialize in to attract the most customers.

Business Questions:

2.	Hours of Operation vs Customer Rating
